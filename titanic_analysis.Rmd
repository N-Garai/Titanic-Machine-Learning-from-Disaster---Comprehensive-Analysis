# Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic disaster dataset, exploring passenger demographics, survival patterns, and building predictive models to understand the factors that contributed to survival. The analysis includes:

- Detailed exploratory data analysis with advanced visualizations
- Feature engineering and data preprocessing
- Multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM)
- Model comparison and selection
- Final predictions and insights

```

# 2. Initial Data Exploration

## 2.1 Dataset Structure

```{r structure}
# Display structure
str(full_data)

# First few rows
head(full_data, 10) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"), 
                font_size = 10) %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")
```

## 2.2 Variable Descriptions

```{r variable_descriptions}
variable_desc <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("PassengerId", "Survived", "Pclass", "Name", "Sex", "Age", 
               "SibSp", "Parch", "Ticket", "Fare", "Cabin", "Embarked"),
  Description = c(
    "Unique identifier for each passenger",
    "Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)",
    "Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)",
    "Passenger name",
    "Gender",
    "Age in years",
    "Number of siblings/spouses aboard",
    "Number of parents/children aboard",
    "Ticket number",
    "Passenger fare",
    "Cabin number",
    "Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)"
  ),
  Type = c("Numeric", "Binary", "Ordinal", "Text", "Categorical", "Numeric",
           "Numeric", "Numeric", "Text", "Numeric", "Text", "Categorical")
)

variable_desc %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

## 2.3 Summary Statistics

```{r summary_stats}
# Summary of training data
summary(train) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

# 3. Missing Data Analysis

```{r missing_data_analysis}
# Calculate missing data
missing_data <- data.frame(
  Variable = names(full_data),
  Missing_Count = sapply(full_data, function(x) sum(is.na(x) | x == "")),
  Missing_Percent = sapply(full_data, function(x) 
    round(sum(is.na(x) | x == "") / length(x) * 100, 2))
) %>%
  arrange(desc(Missing_Count))

missing_data %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

```{r missing_visualization, fig.height=8}
# Visualize missing data
aggr_plot <- aggr(full_data, 
                  col=c('navyblue','red'), 
                  numbers=TRUE, 
                  sortVars=TRUE, 
                  labels=names(full_data), 
                  cex.axis=.7, 
                  gap=3, 
                  ylab=c("Histogram of missing data","Pattern"))
```

**Key Findings on Missing Data:**

- **Cabin**: 77.1% missing - High missingness suggests limited utility
- **Age**: 20.09% missing - Significant, requires imputation
- **Embarked**: 0.15% missing - Minimal, easy to impute
- **Fare**: 0.08% missing - Single value, easy to impute

  kable(col.names = c("Survived", "Count", "Percentage (%)")) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

```{r survival_plot}

# 12. Key Insights and Conclusions

## 12.1 Feature Importance Summary

The most important predictors of survival were:

1. **Gender (Sex)**: Females had a 74% survival rate vs 19% for males
2. **Passenger Class (Pclass)**: First class passengers had 63% survival vs 24% for third class
3. **Title**: Social status indicators strongly correlated with survival
4. **Age**: Children had higher survival rates
5. **Fare**: Higher fare passengers (typically first class) survived more

## 12.2 Model Performance Summary

```{r best_model_summary}
cat("Best Model: Random Forest\n")
cat("Validation Accuracy:", round(rf_cm$overall['Accuracy'], 4), "\n")
cat("Validation Sensitivity (Recall):", round(rf_cm$byClass['Sensitivity'], 4), "\n")
cat("Validation Specificity:", round(rf_cm$byClass['Specificity'], 4), "\n")
cat("Validation F1 Score:", round(rf_cm$byClass['F1'], 4), "\n")
cat("AUC:", round(auc(rf_roc), 4), "\n")
```

## 12.3 Survival Patterns

### Social Class and Gender Dynamics
- **Women and children first** policy was evident: 74.2% of women survived vs 18.9% of men
- **Class privilege**: First class passengers had 2.6x higher survival rate than third class
- **Combined effect**: First class women had the highest survival rate (~97%), while third class men had the lowest (~14%)

### Family Dynamics
- Passengers traveling alone or in very large families had lower survival rates
- Small families (2-4 members) had optimal survival rates
- This suggests family groups could help each other, but very large groups may have been harder to coordinate

### Age Factor
- Children (under 18) had higher survival rates across all classes
- The median age of survivors was slightly lower than non-survivors
- Age interacted with class: first class elderly had better survival than third class children

### Economic Status
- Fare paid was a strong predictor, reflecting both class and cabin location
- Higher fare passengers likely had better cabin locations (closer to lifeboats)
- Economic status provided better access to survival resources

## 12.4 Model Insights

### Random Forest (Best Performer)
- **Strengths**: Handles non-linear relationships, robust to outliers, provides feature importance
- **Performance**: ~84% accuracy with good balance between sensitivity and specificity
- **Feature Selection**: Successfully identified Sex, Title, and Pclass as top predictors

### XGBoost (Close Second)
- **Strengths**: Powerful gradient boosting, excellent for competitions
- **Performance**: ~83% accuracy with highest AUC
- **Use Case**: Could be preferred for final tuning with hyperparameter optimization

### Logistic Regression
- **Strengths**: Interpretable, fast training, good baseline
- **Performance**: ~81% accuracy, reliable but simpler than ensemble methods
- **Feature Coefficients**: Clearly showed positive impact of being female, first class

### SVM
- **Strengths**: Good for high-dimensional spaces
- **Performance**: ~82% accuracy, solid but not superior to tree-based methods
- **Consideration**: Requires more computational resources

## 12.5 Recommendations for Further Improvement

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use grid search or random search for optimal parameters
2. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models (stacking, blending)
3. **Feature Engineering**: 
   - Extract more cabin information (side of ship)
   - Create interaction features (Sex × Class, Age × Class)
   - Analyze ticket patterns more deeply
4. **Cross-Validation**: Implement k-fold CV for more robust validation
5. **Handle Class Imbalance**: Use techniques like SMOTE if needed
6. **Deep Learning**: Try neural networks for potential performance gains

## 12.6 Historical Context

The Titanic disaster occurred on April 15, 1912, when the "unsinkable" ship hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage. Key facts:

- **2,224 passengers and crew** aboard
- **1,502 deaths** (67.5% mortality)
- **Insufficient lifeboats**: Only enough for 1,178 people (53%)
- **Class disparities**: First class had better access to lifeboats
- **Gender protocol**: "Women and children first" was strictly followed

Our analysis confirms historical accounts and quantifies the survival advantages based on gender, class, and age.
